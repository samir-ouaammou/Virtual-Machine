## 🛠️ Born2beRoot - 1337 School Project
Welcome to my Born2beRoot repository! 🚀
The Born2beRoot project is a critical step in the 1337 School curriculum, designed to deepen our understanding of Linux systems, server administration, and cybersecurity principles. This project combines practical system setup with theoretical knowledge of operating systems and network security.

---

## 📊 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create and configure a secure virtual machine (VM) following strict guidelines. You'll manage user permissions, configure firewalls, and enforce security policies while ensuring the system remains functional and robust. This project helps solidify foundational knowledge in system administration and Linux security.

---

## 🔧 Key Features
- Operating System: Deploy a Debian-based Linux distribution or Rocky Linux.
- User Management: Create and manage users, groups, and permissions securely.
- Firewall Setup: Configure a firewall using ufw or iptables to control network traffic.
- SSH Configuration: Secure SSH access with key-based authentication and disabled root login.
- Password Policy: Implement strong password policies, including complexity and expiration rules.
- Cron Jobs: Automate tasks with cron, such as regular system updates or log backups.
- System Monitoring: Set up monitoring tools to track resource usage and system performance.

📂 Usage

1️⃣ Virtual Machine Setup
1.   Install VirtualBox or UTM for VM management.
2.   Deploy the Debian or Rocky Linux image.
3.   Follow the provided configuration checklist to secure the system.

2️⃣ User and Group Management
- Create multiple users with unique permissions.
- Enforce strict password policies using passwd and pam.d configuration.

3️⃣ Firewall and SSH
- Configure ufw or iptables to restrict incoming and outgoing traffic.
- Set up key-based authentication for SSH access.

4️⃣ System Monitoring and Security
- Install monitoring tools like htop, vnstat, or netstat.
- Use auditd to monitor system logs for unauthorized access attempts.

---

## 🎯 Challenges Overcome
- Configuring a secure and functional Linux system from scratch.
- Managing permissions and groups while enforcing strict password policies.
- Understanding and implementing security best practices for SSH and firewall rules.
- Automating tasks using cron and managing system resources effectively.

---

## 🏆 Key Achievements
- Successfully implemented a secure, functional virtual machine.
- Gained in-depth knowledge of Linux system administration.
- Learned how to configure firewalls, secure SSH, and enforce system policies.

---

## 🚀 Next Steps
With Born2beRoot completed, I am now focused on:

- Enhancing my knowledge of advanced Linux security and administration.
- Exploring automation tools like Ansible and Docker for scalable system management.
- Diving deeper into cybersecurity concepts and penetration testing.

---

## 🌟 Reflection
The Born2beRoot project was both challenging and rewarding. It pushed me to think critically about system security, user management, and network configuration. The skills I gained will be invaluable as I continue my journey in system administration and cybersecurity.
